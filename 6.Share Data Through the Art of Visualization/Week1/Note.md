### Design thinking for data visualization involves these five phases:

* Empathize: Thinking about the emotions and needs of the target audience for the data visualization 
* Define: Figuring out exactly what your audience needs from the data
* Ideate: Generating ideas for data visualization
* Prototype: Putting visualizations together for testing and feedback
* Test: Showing prototype visualizations to people before stakeholders see them

### When to use chart

* Change: This is a trend or instance of observations that become different over time. A great way to measure change in data is through a line chart, histogram, or bar graph.
* Clustering: A collection of data points with similar or different values. This is best represented through a distribution graph.
* Relativity: These are observations considered in relation or in proportion to something else. You have probably seen examples of relativity data in a pie chart.
* Ranking: This is a position in a scale of achievement or status. Data that requires ranking is best represented by a bar graph.
* Correlation: This shows a mutual relationship or connection between two or more things. A scatter plot is an excellent way to represent this type of data pattern.
