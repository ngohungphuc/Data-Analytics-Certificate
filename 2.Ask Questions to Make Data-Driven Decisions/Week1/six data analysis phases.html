                      There are six data analysis phases that will help you make
                      seamless decisions: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,
                      and act. This is different from the data lifecycle we have
                      been learning about. While that describes the changes data
                      goes through over its lifetime, these six steps describe the
                      data analysis process. Let’s walk through the steps to see
                      how they can help you resolve problems you will face on the
                      job.&nbsp;

                    <p>
                      It’s impossible to solve a problem if you don’t know what it
                      is. These are some things to consider:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Define the problem you’re trying to solve</li>
                      <li>
                        Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s
                        expectations
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of
                        communication
                      </li>
                      <li>

                      <li>What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?</li>
                      <li>

                      You will decide what data you need to collect in order to
                      answer your questions and how to organize it so that it is
                      useful. You might use your business task to decide:&nbsp;

                      <li>What metrics to measure</li>

                      Clean data is the best data and you will need to clean up
                      your data to get rid of any possible errors, inaccuracies,
                      or inconsistencies. This might mean:

                      <li>

                      You will want to think analytically about your data. At this

                      your analysis using data viz tools like graphs or
                      dashboards. This is your chance to show the stakeholders you

                    <p>
                      Now it’s time to act on your data. You will take everything
                      you have learned from your data analysis and put it to use.
                      This could mean providing your stakeholders with
                      recommendations based on your findings so they can make
                      data-driven decisions.

                      These six steps can help you to break the data analysis
                      process into smaller, manageable parts, which is called
                      <strong>structured thinking</strong>. This process involves
                      four basic activities:

                      When you are starting out in your career as a data analyst,
                      it is normal to feel pulled in a few different directions
                      with your role and expectations. Following processes like
                      the ones outlined here and using structured thinking skills
                      can help get you back on track, fill in any&nbsp;gaps and
                      let you know exactly what you need.
